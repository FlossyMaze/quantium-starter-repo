British Airways Reviews Analysis
This repository showcases a project focused on gathering, analyzing, and visualizing customer review data for British Airways. The work is organized as a series of tasks designed to demonstrate real-world data extraction and insight generation techniques, making it an excellent resource for learning about web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization.

Project Overview
The project is divided into two main phases:

Web Scraping Reviews
The first task involves web scraping to extract review data from online sources. This part of the project demonstrates:

Data Extraction: Retrieving customer reviews from the target website.
Data Cleaning: Parsing the raw HTML, extracting relevant text, and cleaning the data for analysis.
Preparation for Analysis: Organizing the scraped data into a structured format suitable for further exploration.
Data Analysis & Visualization
The second phase builds on the scraped data to provide insights and visualizations. It covers:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data to identify trends, sentiment, and other key metrics.
Visualization: Using Python libraries to create graphs and charts that help communicate the findings effectively.
In-depth Analysis: Applying statistical methods and visualization techniques to interpret customer feedback and identify improvement areas.
