# British Airways Reviews Analysis
This repository showcases a project focused on gathering, analyzing, and visualizing customer review data for British Airways. The work is organized as a series of tasks designed to demonstrate real-world data extraction and insight generation techniques, making it an excellent resource for learning about web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization.

## Project Overview ##
The project is divided into two main phases:

1. Web Scraping Reviews\
The first task involves web scraping to extract review data from online sources. This part of the project demonstrates:
Data Extraction: Retrieving customer reviews from the target website.
Data Cleaning: Parsing the raw HTML, extracting relevant text, and cleaning the data for analysis.
Preparation for Analysis: Organizing the scraped data into a structured format suitable for further exploration.<br><br>
2. Data Analysis & Visualization\
The second phase builds on the scraped data to provide insights and visualizations. It covers:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data to identify trends, sentiment, and other key metrics.
Visualization: Using Python libraries to create graphs and charts that help communicate the findings effectively.
In-depth Analysis: Applying statistical methods and visualization techniques to interpret customer feedback and identify improvement areas.
